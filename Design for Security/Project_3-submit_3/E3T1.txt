The AWS GuardDuty catches a couple of brute force attacks:

- An instance is trying to perform an SSH brute force attack
- An instance is being attacked by an SSH brute force attack

AWS Guard Duty documentation explains how it applies machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence to identify and prioritize potential threats; and the data sources for AWS to analyze these are AWS CloudTrail, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs.
In this exercise, our CloudFormation Stack deployed has VPC flow logs written to an S3 bucket which is being analyzed by GuardDuty.
The logs show multiple requests being sent from an instance to a specific IP indicating that it is being used for an SSH brute force attack.
The instance recieving these requests in logs can be ascribed to be the instance under this brute force attack.
