Based on the network architecture, we can identify the following problems and the solutions to them:

1. The access to the ports is easily accessible if malicious scripts attempt to login and get the secret recipes

Solution: In order to restrict such attempts, we can restrict the access to the instance by allowing access to the ports via the Load Balancer only and no SSH attempts to login.

2. The buckets aren't configured for the Defensive Cloud Strategy with any encryption to protect from unauthorized access.

Solution: We must protect our data with KMS service or simply configure the S3-Managed Keys for all our recipe vault buckets.
